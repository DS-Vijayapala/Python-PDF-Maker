PDF Notebook Generator 📄✍️
This Python app generates a structured PDF notebook from a CSV file (topics.csv). It uses fpdf to create lined pages for note-taking and pandas for data processing.

Features:
✅ Generates a PDF with multiple pages per topic
✅ Header & Footer: Each page includes a topic title and footer
✅ Lined Pages: Adds horizontal lines for easy note-taking
✅ Custom Page Count: Reads the number of pages per topic from the CSV

How It Works:
Ensure topics.csv has the following columns:
"Topic" (Title of the section)
"Pages" (Number of pages for the topic)
Run the script

Output : Creates a pdf file similar to the example.pdf

The script creates an Example.pdf file with formatted pages.
📌 Perfect for generating custom notebooks, study guides, or journals! 🚀
